These progressive examples illustrate how to build your apps out of reusable modules.  Each example adds a couple modules and remixes old ones to create different apps our of the same modules.  
  
Several of the examples use callbacks, don't worry if you don't understand this. The purpose of including them is to illustrate the power of modular design, and to give an example of dependency injection.   
  
We'll cover callbacks in detail with the Async Refactor code along, including another read through of this series.
