Solving","keywords":"","body":"Constriant-Based Problem Solving\nOne of the most important skills you can learn to become a 10x developer is to write exactly and only the simplest code necessary.  This skill is much harder to learn and much more valuable than being able to write cool applications or being able to code challenging algorithms.\nThis lesson is a small practical guide this skill.  For a look at the bigger picture of why this is so valuable, check out this post on our blog.\nIndex\n\nconstraints   \nanalysis first\ndecomposition\ncommon constraints  \ncollaboration process  \nstudying like this \nresources\n\n\nConstraints\nConstraints force you to commit to one path and follow it through.  They force you to think creatively in order to work around them.  They force you to focus your energies onto a smaller set of possible solutions. Adding constraints improves and accelerates creative problem solving.\nIt may sound intuitively wrong, but the fewer restrictions you have on your work the more difficult it is to be creative.  One of the crucial skills you need to learn is when and how to place restrictions on yourself.  \nSpecs are a perfect example of self-imposed constraints that help enormously in producing a final product.  Without the structure of agreed-upon specs you would have to spend much more of your time remembering what you're doing and how it fits with the last piece you built.  \nOn the group level, specs are indispensible.  Without agreeing on specs before beginning to code, it's almost guarenteed that your team's code will not work when you piece it together.  By constraining yourselves to a set of specs, you are free as a group to take more liberties in implementation and workflow with the confidence that your project will work when everyone has finished their piece.\nTOP\n\nAnalysis First\nWhen presented with a new problem, it is a waste of time to start by trying to solve it.  The moment you begin thinking of solutions, you limit your energies to debating or improving the proposed solutions rather than looking for new perspectives on the problem.\nBefore even considering solutions, you should spend more time than you want to conidering the problem from every angle. This is also not intuitive, but a crucial skill to understand and practice.\nAs a developer, you are very rarely solving a problem that has been exactly solved before (or you'd be using someone else's code).  You will rarely have much guidance.  You will often have have a lot of freedom in coming up with your solution.  This is not the best situation for creative problem solving.\nYou must manage your time and your patience to maximize your efforts.  By spending extra time understading the problem then even more selecting the correct constraints for yourself, you will be saving yourself and your team time in the future.\n\n“Given one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem and 5 minutes finding the solution.” ~ Albert Einstein\n\nTOP\n\nCommon Constraints\nThis list is long and it's not even near comprehensive.  Rather than looking it as an enormous list of shutdowns, try thinking of it as a bunch of decisions you don't have to make.  Free yourself!\nSome common constraints when developing software:\n\nThe audiences:\nA user must understand your applicaiton.\nDevelopers must understand your code.\nComputers must run your code.\n\n\nOther people\nBad legacy code\nUnpleasant team-mates\nBad junior developers\nEven worse senior developers\nBad managers\nImpossible customers\n\n\nYourself\nSkill/experience limitations\nTool familiarity\nBad work habits\nBad attitude\nPoor team-working skills\n\n\nDevelopment\nDeadlines\nBudgets\nSpecs\nUnexpected changes in any of these\nArchitecture \n\n\nTechnology stacks:\nProgramming languages\nFrameworks \nLack of frameworks\nCompatibility\n\n\nHardware, yours and users:\nSpeed\nPrice\nOS\n\n\nAnd so so many more ...\n\nTOP\n\nDecomposition\nProblem decomposition is central to problem solving.  Being able to look at a large problem and understand it as many small problems strung together will make you a better human.  \nSome of many advantages:      \n\nYou have created helpful constraints.  Two smaller problems are easier to approach and will usually result in a higher quality finished product.  \nCollaboration becomes easier. You can split work with the guarentee that each person's contribution will be valuable.  \nIt can guide the analysis phase.  Often the hardest question is how to start understanding a problem. by first decomposing a new problem, you can skip being confused by how to start.  Decomposing is always worth your time.  \nSmaller pieces are easier to code.

Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API's functionality.\n\nDownload it here\n\nLet's go back to the random user generator api example. Instead of writing out a whole new route and function to perform the request, then I would have to specify with more code what I want the response to look like, and finally I would have to print out the response to the console or provide some other way of actually viewing the response. Granted, I would probably need to write all this out anyway to make a functioning app using this API, but doing all this to simply test an API's functionality is unnecessarily tedious and time consuming when something like Postman exists.\nWith Postman, such a test is much more streamlined. All I have to do is plug the route into the address bar, select the GET response method on the dropdown box to its left, specify that I want the response in “pretty” JSON format, and hit send. Then, I get the response data in easy-to-read JSON with a status code of 200, confirming the GET request was successful. It’s that simple!\nPostman let's you also add headers. Let's say we want to make use of the Google Maps API, for which we need an API key. We could then simply add this api key as a header and hit send. \nForms and post requests\nWe could also use Postman to test post requests (sending data to the api), actually Postman supports all HTTP requests, but we'll focus on post here.\nTesting a post request isn't that complicated. You first select the POST method instead of GET. You'll notice that you now have access to the body of the request. Here you'll have to define the format with which the data will be sent. If you're planning to use HTML forms (for example user registration), you'll need to select the x-www-form-urlencoded option. This will make it possible to send key-value pairs to the api. If it works, you should then get some kind of success message.\n"},"key-resources/using-this-curriculum.html":{"url":"key-resources/using-this-curriculum.html","title":"Using This Curriculum","keywords":"","body":"follow the projects in order.

This is largely a good thing, but has a down-side.\nThe downside is that you can't \"figure out\" how things work.  With pure JS you can read through it and study it to figure out what the code does.  When reading an Express project or seeing jQuery for the first time, it would takes months of console-logging to figure out how things work. Reading the source code wouldn't be any more productive.  The best way to learn a library is to listen to the person who wrote it.\nDocumentaiton is the developer's way to tell you how to use their code - args, return values, behavior.  The modules we'll be using in class have good documentation.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” — Martin Fowler\nDevelopers spend SO MUCH more time reading code than writing it.  This is true even with your own code.  As a favor to yourself and whoever will need to use, maintain or develop your code, please learn to write readable code. \nDocumentation does not remove the need for readable code.  Documentation is for users with no interest in reading source code; readable code is for developers who want to study, modify, fix, update, or in anyother way work with your codebase. (Including your futur self.  Love yourself.)  \nThere are many different opinions on what constitutes great JavaScript code.  The most important thing is just that you're consistent.  The war between coders that use tabs and coders that use spaces to indent their code is so engrained that it's essentially a joke by now, but it doesn't really matter as long as you're consistent.\n\nSelf-Documenting Code\nSelf-documenting code is code that reads almost like a very nerdy book.  \nYou have already begun your journey towards self-documenting code and you didn't even know it.  If you look to the process presented in tictactoes, the step from specs to empty code is giving you the start of a user-friendly project. The specs can become documentation for end-users, while the codebase is on it's way to being developmer-friendly:\n\nThe comments are pulled from the 'purpose' field of the spec - this gaurentees that you will have a 'why' comment for each component of the code. \nYou are building your code around pure functions.\nThe required functions, arguments, and return values are pre-declared with descriptive names.\nGlorious.\n\nRules of Thumb\nStructural:\n\nPlace all the 'workings' of your app in one place.  This means function calls, important variable assignments (or reassignment), and any other lines crucial to understanding your code.   With good naming, this can make your app read like a continuous story instead of a bunch of sentences split up through a phone book. (see example) \nUse single-purpose, pure functions with simple, understandable behavior.\nHave a helpful directory structure\nWithin a single file - organize variables, functions, objects, ... in a way that makes sense so you don't have to rescan the whole file all the time.\n\nNaming:\n\nAll names of things describe what they do, even if it means having realllly long names. \nWrite helpful error messages\nDecide on and stick to a naming convention. ie. camelCase or under_scores, var forty_two = 42, ...\n\nSyntax:\n\nUse prettier.js to make your coding style consistent. (white space, code blocks, functions, ... visually consistent)\n\n\nShow intermediate values. ie. none of this: (array[3])()[title].name.splice(3)\nPhrase things in the most clear way, not the most 'elegant' or short way.  No one will care how brilliant you are when they're 15 minutes in and just starting to understand your code. (personal experience here)\n\nDo Complete Refactors.  \n\nWhen your application or code changes, go through (at least most of) your codebase to reflect that change - modify variable and function names, reorganize what functions do what, even change your directory strucutre.  \n\nThe better you are about starting with readable code, the easier it will be to keep your code readable.\n\nTwo Examples\n1\nConsider the following 2 snippets of JavaScript:\n// difficult to read\nconst x = \nfunction(z) {\nlet w = 0;z.forEach(\nfunction(q){\n     w += q;\n});return w;\n};\n\nx([2, 2, 2]);\n\n// easy to read\nconst sumArray = function(array) {\n  let sum = 0;\n  array.forEach(function(number) {\n    sum += number;\n  });\n  return sum;\n};\n\nsumArray([2, 2, 2]);\n\nBelieve it or not, both of those functions do the exact same thing (in the exact same way!), and both of them are perfectly valid code, but obviously the second one is much easier to follow.  Imagine you're working on a project with someone else and they've written the first function... how long is it going to take you to figure out what's going on there so you can do your work?  Imagine you're working on a project all by yourself and YOU wrote the first function a week or two ago... chances are good that you aren't going to remember exactly what you were up to there and it's still going to take you a good while to figure it all out again.\nThe second one, however, is much easier to follow.  Even if you don't know exactly what everything in the code is doing, things are named clearly enough that you could guess, and the indentation is consistent enough that it's easy to parse the different parts of the function.\n2\n\n // -----------  Define things in one place ------------ //\n var command_line_args = process.argv.slice(2);\n var first_arg = command_line_args[0];\n var second_arg = command_line_args[1];\n function check_input_type(input, expected_type) {\n         // return true or false\n     };\n function add_two_numbers(num_1, num_2) {\n         // return the sum of num_1, num_2\n     };\n function display_to_user(result) {\n         // console log result\n     };\n\n // ------------- Use the stuff you defined elsewhere --------------- //\n var first_arg_is_valid = check_input_type( first_arg );\n var second_arg_is_valid = check_input_type( second_arg );\n if (first_arg_is_valid && second_arg_is_valid) {\n     var sum_of_args = add_two_numbers( first_arg, second_arg );\n     display_to_user( sum_of_args );\n } else {\n     display_to_user( \" invalid argument types \" );\n };\n\nThis is overkill for code that only adds two numbers, but it gets the point across. In more complicated or abstract programs the time spent writing clear code will more than pay off later.\n\n\n\nResources\nMandatory reads:\n\navoid comments\nwhen you can't, make sure they help\nand certainly learn to know when they are apropriate  \ncode for the maintainer.

We won't talk about this paradigm in class but it's worth a look if you're interested\n\n\nLiterate resources:\n\nA tool for writing literate programs.

If you search online you'll find great debates over which frameworks to use and how to fit tests into your development cycle.  Underlying all sides of the arguments are a few universal concepts.  This lesson will attempt to teach the universal fundamentals then set you off on the right track to learn the rest.\nThe first part of this lesson will cover testing fundamentals culminating in the backbone of (almost) all testing paradigms and frameworks - the test suite: \n\nPure Functions\nSpecifications\nUnit Tests\nTest Suites\n\nThe second part of this lesson will give some ideas for incorporating testing into your dev process, and introduce our favorite testing framework:  \n\nBDD, TDD  \nMinimal Passing Functions  \nGradual Refactoring  \nJasmine, testing framework  \n\nTOP\n\nSpecs\nSpecs are a crucial part of planning code before writing code.  If you are going to follow the TDD or BDD testing paradigms, it's best you get a hang of these now.\nA specification is plain text that describes everything needed for someone to build code with a given functionality.  If specs are well written (and well followed) all implementations will be interchangeable.   My code may be faster than yours, and hers may be easier to read, and his uses less memory, but we could close our eyes to pick one and the application will still work the same.  \nIf you are careful to build pure functions you only need to specify 3 things to fully describe your code: \n\nARGUMENTS:  The number of arguments your function needs and the type of each one. \nRETURN TYPE: The type of whatever is to the right of your return statement.  If there is no return statement, Javascript defaults to returning 'undefined'.   \nBEHAVIOR:  A high level description of what happens between the curly braces. If this gets longer than 2 lines you should think about breaking your function into littler functions.\n\nSpecs for the division function above.  It's import that everything is spelt the same in your specs and your function:\n\ndivision: function  \nARGS: 2  \na: number  \nb: number\n\n\nRETURN: number  \nBEHAVIOR: Divides a by b, if b is not 0.  Returns the result or 'undefined', depending on the inputs.\n\n\n\nTOP\n\nTest Cases\nTest Cases are the simplest possible example of something called a higher order function.  Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments.  Let's take a look at some specs for a test case to see how they work: \n\ntest_case: function\nARGS: 1\ntestee: function\n\n\nRETURN: boolean\nBEHAVIOR: Executes testee with a hard-coded set of arguments and compares the returned value against an expected result.  Returns true or fals according to the comparison.\n\n\n\nThese are the atoms of all testing.  You build test cases for each function (or method) based on it's specs.\nBelow is a series of Test Cases for the division function.  Coming up with a good collection of test cases means determining what are the important classifications of input/output pairs and testing each one.  The principle is very simple. Coming up with them is easy but time consuming.  Coming up with good ones is challenging and worth the effort.  There is no better way to understand a function than coming up with a good set of test cases.  \nfunction test_1_division(testee) {  // positive, positive\n    var a = 3;\n    var b = 3;\n    var expected = 1;\n    var result = testee(a, b);\n    if(result == expected) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    };\n};\nfunction test_2_division(testee) { // negative, negative\n    var a = -3;\n    var b = -3;\n    var expected = 1;\n    var result = testee(a, b);\n    if(result == expected) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    };\n};\nfunction test_3_division(testee) { // positive, negative\n    var a = 3;\n    var b = -3;\n    var expected = -1;\n    var result = testee(a, b);\n    if(result == expected) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    };\n};\nfunction test_4_division(testee) { // negative, positive\n    var a = -3;\n    var b = 3;\n    var expected = -1;\n    var result = testee(a, b);\n    if(result == expected) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    };\n};\nfunction test_5_division(testee) { // non-0, 0\n    var a = 3;\n    var b = 0;\n    var expected = undefined;\n    var result = testee(a, b);\n    if(result == expected) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    };\n};\nfunction test_6_division(testee) { // 0, non-0\n    var a = 0;\n    var b = 3;\n    var expected = 0;\n    var result = testee(a, b);\n    if(result == expected) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    };\n};\n\n(Take a moment to notice how much more difficult this would be if testee weren't a pure function.)  \nTOP\n\nUnit Tests\nThe Unit Test is what ties all these cases together, each unit test tests one unit of code. In this case we're testing the division function.   It's no huge conceptual leap forward, but it makes life a lot easier.This one isn't a pure function, what would you have to change to make it one?\nfunction division_unit_test(testee) {\n    var result = [];\n    if(test_1_division(testee)) {  // +/+\n        result.push('PASS +/+');\n    } else {\n        result.push('fail +/+');\n    };\n    if(test_2_division(testee)) {  // -/-\n        result.push('PASS -/-');\n    } else {\n        result.push('fail -/-');\n    };\n    if(test_3_division(testee)) {  // +/-\n        result.push('PASS +/-');\n    } else {\n        result.push('fail +/-');\n    };\n    if(test_4_division(testee)) {  // -/+\n        result.push('PASS -/+');\n    } else {\n        result.push('fail -/+');\n    };\n    if(test_5_division(testee)) {  // +/0\n        result.push('PASS +/0');\n    } else {\n        result.push('fail +/0');\n    };\n    if(test_6_division(testee)) {  // 0/+\n        result.push('PASS 0/+');\n    } else {\n        result.push('fail 0/+');\n    };\n    return result;\n};\n\nTOP\n\nNext Level Unit Test\nIf you're a real programmer you'll be annoyed by all the repetition in the unit test above. \nfigure out how all this world:\nfunction unit_test(testee, args, expected) {\n    var result = testee(...args);\n    return result == expected;\n};\n\nfunction division(a, b) {\n    var result = 0000;\n    // logic\n    return result;\n};\n\nvar division_test_cases = [\n    { args: [3, 3], expected: 1, name: '+/+' },\n    { args: [-3, -3], expected: 1, name: '-/-' },\n    { args: [3, -3], expected: -1, name: '+/-' },\n    { args: [-3, 3], expected: -1, name: '-/+' },\n    { args: [3, 0], expected: undefined, name: 'non-0/0' },\n    { args: [0, 3], expected: 0, name: '0/non-0' }\n];\n\nfunction test_suite(test, testee, cases) {\n    var results = [];\n    for(var test_case in cases) {\n        result.push(test(testee, test_case.args, test_case.expected)); \n    };\n    return results;\n};\n\nfunction result_interpreter(test_results, test_cases) {\n    var interpretation = [];\n    for(var i = 0; i \nTOP\n\nMinimal Passing Functions\nYou've just seen unit tests and have probably heard of B/TDD, but how does it all happen?\nUnit tests in conjuntion with minimal passing functions can be used to organize your development process helping you to catch bugs, keep your code simple and on task, and to make sure you aren't overcomplicating your life.  \nThis is the heart of the B/TDD development philosophies. \nA minimal passing function is just the simplest possible function that will pass it's unit test.  To the point of uselessness.  The example below contains a unit test and a simplest passing function for addition:\nfunction additionTester(testee) {\n    var tested = testee(4, 5);\n    var message = '';\n    if (tested == 9) {\n        message = 'success';\n    } else {\n        message = 'failure';\n    };\n    return message;\n};\n\nfunction addition(a, b) {\n    return 9;\n};\n\nThis minimal function seems useless, it just returns the right answer!  A simplest passing function will do nothing but pass the test.   That's the goal in B/TDD. If the test asks for an array, the function returns an array.  If the test asks for 'Chlotilde', the function returns 'Chlotilde'.  If the test asks to salt and hash a user's password, that's what it does.\nOnce a function passes one test, you refactor it a bit to pass more tests and to be better code.  Test it again.  Refactor. Repeat, and you're on your way to B/TDD.\nTOP\n\nGradual Refactoring\nUsing unit tests and minimal functions probably won't come naturally.  Here are a few steps you can practice to begin incorporating them into your development process:\n\nWrite your empty code (all necessary functions/objects/variables with nothing between the curly braces) according to your specs:      function addition(a, b) {\n }; // (this would be more intersting in a larger program)\n\n\nFill it in with dummy return values of the right type so it 'works' (you can call everything without it breaking, but nothing happens): function addition(a, b) {\n     var sum = 0000;\n     // logic\n     return sum\n };\n\n\nWhile project isn't finished:\nmake a separate branch for the feature/module/function you are working on.\ngradually test->pass->refactor that bit of code gradually upping your test-passing expectations with each iteration. Shoot for new fringe cases, trickier inputs, it's almost a game between you and the test writer: // Can you guess what test conditions were passed with each new step?\n function addition(a, b) {    // first iteration\n     var sum = 0000;\n     // logic\n     return sum;\n };\n function addition(a, b) {    // second iteration\n     var sum = 0000;\n     sum = a + b;\n     return sum;\n };\n function addition(a, b) {    // third iteration\n     var sum = 0000;\n     if ((typeof(a)=='number') && (typeof(b)=='number')) {\n         sum = a + b;\n     };\n     return sum;\n };\n function addition(a, b) {    // final iteration\n     var result;\n     if ((typeof(a)=='number') && (typeof(b)=='number')) {\n         result = a + b;\n     } else {\n         result = undefined;\n     };\n     return sum;\n };\n\n (It's important that you only modify the single piece of code while on it's branch. If you planned well from the beginning it shouldn't depend on anything else to pass it's tests)\nAfter the branch is finished, merge it back into master.\n\n\nLaunch first version and continue on to the next, repeating this process.\n\nTOP\n\nBDD and TDD\nThe 'DD methods of development require you to plan before and while you write code - always a good thing.

Algorithms (or programs) are by their nature very abstract, and by the time they're actually being executed they're a string of 1's and 0's no matter what paradigm you use.  Somewhere between us wanting something to happen and the computer carrying out the task, there needs to be a middle ground we both understand. That middle ground is programming languages and programming paradigms.  \nProgramming Languages\nFrom the computer's side we have programming languages.  A programming language is designed from the bottom up to communicate with your computer - to compile to machine code and be executed.  At one conceptual end of a programming language is machine code, at the other is human-decipherable syntax.  JS for example. \nProgramming Paradigms\nFrom the human's side we have developed paradigms that rephrase algorithms into something we can begin to grasp with our intuitions.  \nIntuitions are created when we internalize the rules by which some system operates.  Humans have enormous capacity for intuition; you can ride bikes and drive cars without thinking, you can talk without planning every word, you can guess what others are thinking or feeling.  Unfortunatly for you there is very little in life that works anything like coding, so its rare to have strong intuitions for coding.  Some rare people just do have the right intuition, don't worry about them.  Every other good programmer has developed their intuition for programming by spending enough focused time to allow their brains to build an intuition. \nProgramming paradigms emerged to address this issue.  By thinking of algorithms as 'like x' you can understand them more effectively.  There are many paradigms out there, and each one has a host of programming languages that support their way of thinking: HTML fits a declarative paradigm, Java supports OOP, Haskal supports functional programming, Cat supports concatinative programming, ... The list is nearly endless and each one encourages programmers to think slightly differently. The best strategy depends on the person, the machine, and the need.\nJavaScript is a strange mutt, it natively supports much of what is needed for the most popular paradigms.  What it doesn't support natively, someone has probably written a library to implement.  As a student this puts you in a tricky position; You'll have to be extra diligent or you could slip very easily into very bad habits.

You can't begin to buy a train ticket until all the people in front of you have finished buying theirs. Similarly, the people behind you can't start buying their tickets until you have bought yours.\nAsynchronous Code\nIn asynchronous programs, you can have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), where L1 schedules some task to be run in the future, but L2 runs before that task completes.\nYou can imagine as if you are eating at a sit-down restaurant. Other people order their food. You can also order your food. You don't have to wait for them to receive their food and finish eating before you order. Similarly, other people don't have to wait for you to get your food and finish eating before they can order. Everybody will get their food as soon as it is finished cooking.\nNote that asynchronous does not mean the same thing as concurrent or multi-threaded. JavaScript can have asynchronous code, but it is generally single-threaded. This is like a restaurant with a single worker who does all of the waiting and cooking. But if this worker works quickly enough and can switch between tasks efficiently enough, then the restaurant seemingly has multiple workers.\nLet's show this with an example:\n// Say Hello\nconsole.log(\"Hello\");\n// Say Goodbye 2 seconds from now\nsetTimeout(function(){\n    console.log(\"Goodbye\")\n}, 2000);\n// Say Hello again\nconsole.log(\"Hello\");\n\nHow do you expect this code to be run? In which order will the three statements be executed? Run the code in the console to check if your thought were correct.\nBecause of its asynchronousity JS will not wait until the setTimeout function is finished before it moves on to the next line. Instead it will store the code momentarily away in a callback queue and execute the next line.\nWatch this great video to have a better understanding of how this works. It has also has a litte sandbox where you can test this out.\nUnderstanding asynchronousity is the bread and butter of JS and web development. Often you will send requests to API's and you'll want to do something with the response. If you misunderstand JS, you will run into a whole lot of trouble. JS has a couple of ways to handle this kind of requests. The traditional way and the one you absolutely need to know if you want to find a job in this field is called a callback function. We'll describe this more in detail in below. Later we'll also talk about Promises, which were introduced with ES6 to tackle these kind of problems. With the advent of ES7 you now also have something called async functions, but these only run in Google Chrome for now and we won't go deeper into those.\nCallbacks\nUnlike some other programming languages, in JavaScript you can pass a function as an argument in another function. In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects; that is, functions are of the type Object and they can be used in a first-class manner like any other object (String, Array, Number, etc.) since they are in fact objects themselves.\nBecause functions are first-class objects, we can pass a function as an argument in another function and later execute that passed-in function or even return it to be executed later. This is the essence of using callback functions in JavaScript.\nA callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function (let’s call this other function “otherFunction”) as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction. A callback function is essentially a pattern (an established solution to a common problem), and therefore, the use of a callback function is also known as a callback pattern.\nWhen you were using event listeners as part of the DOM manipulation, you were already using callback functions!!\nvar someDiv = document.getElementById(\"someDiv\");\nsomeDiv.addEventListener(\"click\", function(){ //This is a callback function! It says, after a \"Click\" run this function\n    alert(\"I clicked some div\");\n})\n\nAlternatively, you could split up the code like this:\nvar someDiv = document.getElementById(\"someDiv\");\n\nsomeDiv.addEventListener(\"click\", myFunction); // No parentheses here!\n\nfunction myFunction(){\n    alert(\"I clicked some div\")\n};\n\nAnd when you see this code, do you have a better understanding of what it does:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr.forEach(function(el){ // Yes, that's a callback function!\n    return el * 2\n})\n\nSo how would you go about writing functions that take callback functions as arguments? Let's look at this example:\nvar db = [];\n// A user data object\nvar userData = {\n    name: \"Evan Cole\",\n    age: 26,\n    nationality: \"\\'Murican\"\n};\n\n// a function that prints out user data\nfunction printData(userData){\n    for (key in userData){\n        console.log(key + \": \" + userData[key]);\n    }\n};\n\n// a function that takes as arguments the data and a callback function\nfunction getData(inputData, callback){\n    // do something with the data. Store it to a DB for example\n    db.push(inputData);\n    callback(inputData);\n};\n\n//call the function with the data and the callback function\ngetData(userData, printData);\n\nIn the above example you want to make sure the printing of the data only happens after you've received the data. That's why you write a function that gets data first and then call a second function that prints the data. This way you're avoiding that JS moves on to next line, without having retrieved all the data.\n// without callback. You've defined a function that gets data from an external API\n// you store it in a var\nvar data = getData(someURI); // connects to a server, gets the data, processes the data,...\n\n// Immediately afterwards, display the data in your page\ndocument.getElementById(\"someDiv\").innerHTML = data;\n\nChances are that in above example the page will remain empty! JS will run the getData function, but may move on to the next line before receiving all the data. That's why you need to wrap this up in a callback!\nAsynchronous JavaScript and XML: AJAX\nAJAX is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript.\nAJAX calls are made by using the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object. This is an API in the form of an object whose methods transfer data between a web browser and a web server. The object is provided by the browser's JavaScript environment. We won't go too deep into this object, if you want to know more you read up about here. We will instead focus on so-called Promise-based httpRequest API's such as the more recently built-in API Fetch and third-party modules such as Axios and SuperAgent.\nExercises\n\nGo here\nwatch this and play with the site  \na great article  \nsome slides  \nJS callback conventions\nmore on js callback conventions\n\nProject\nClick here to go the project.\nFetch\nThe Fetch API is a built-in javascript interface for fetching resources (including across the network).\nIt has a relatively simple syntax and it uses Promises to handle results/callbacks.\nThe syntax looks like this: fetch(URL(required), options(optional)).then(response).catch(error).\nSo fetch sends a request to an url to retrieve data from, and optionally some options, such as method (GET,POST,...). It will return a response which can be handled in the then statement.\nLet's make a request to an API. Introducing the Random People API!!\nfetch(\"https://randomuser.me/api/\")\n  .then(response => response.json()) // wil return JSON so let's parse that\n  .then(data => console.log(data)) // let's examine what this returns\n\n// I only want the name:\n\nfetch(\"https://randomuser.me/api/\")\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => alert(data.results[0].name.first + \" \" + data.results[0].name.last))\n\nFetch API\nheaders\nRequest\nResponse\n\nAxios\nAxios is a third-party module used in the browser and node to make request to internal or external API's. It makes use of the built-in XMLHttpRequest object to send or retrieve data.\nAs this is a third-party module it will need to be imported into your global environment. \nExamples\n// Make a request for a user with a given ID\naxios.get('/user?ID=12345')\n  .then(function (response) {\n    console.log(response);\n  })\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n\n// performing a post request\naxios.post('/user', {\n    firstName: 'Fred',\n    lastName: 'Flintstone'\n  })\n  .then(function (response) {\n    console.log(response);\n  })\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n\nExternal Resources\n\nAxios: https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios\nhttps://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-axios-166cb0035237\n\n\nAsync 2: Promises\nA Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. A promise may be created using its constructor. However, most people are consumers of already-created promises returned from functions. This segment will therefore explore consumption of returned promises first.\nEssentially, a promise is a returned object you attach callbacks to, instead of passing callbacks into a function.\nSyntax\nWe won't worry about the Promise constructor just now. If you're interested you can read more about it here.\nWhat you need to know now is how to handle API's that return a Promise-object. We will talk about a couple examples of this later.\nFor now this is the syntax you need to worry about:\nfunction(arguments).then(onfulfill).catch(onreject).\n\nfunction returning a promise: this is a function that will return a Promise-object, i.e it will send a request and receive a response back which will have to be fulfilled .\nWhen the promise has been fulfilled we write code in the thenable what should happen next.\nIf the promise failed or has been rejected, we write code in the catch statement for error handling.\n\nLet's look back at our previous example to see the difference: \n//with a callback\nfunction getData(inputData, callback){\n    db.push(inputData);\n    callback(inputData);\n};\n\ngetData(userData, printData);\n\nLet's assume getData returns a Promise, to resolve it would look something like this:\n// instead of a callback we add a thenable\ngetData(userData)\n  .then(function(result){\n      return printData(result)\n      })\n  .catch(function(error){return error})\n\n// or in ES6\ngetData(userData).then(result => printdata(result)).catch(error => error)  // much neater\n\n\nPromises vs Callbacks\nUnlike old-style passed-in callbacks, a promise comes with some guarantees:\n\nPromises will never be called before the completion of the current run of the JavaScript event loop.\nPromises added with .then even after the success or failure of the asynchronous operation, will be called, as above.\nMultiple promises may be added by calling .then several times, to be executed independently in insertion order.\n\nBut the most immediate benefit of promises is chaining.\nChaining\nA common need is to execute two or more asynchronous operations back to back, where each subsequent operation starts when the previous operation succeeds, with the result from the previous step. We accomplish this by creating a promise chain.\nImagine if the then statement would also return a promise:\ndoSomething() // returns a promise\n  .then(function(result){\n      return doSomethingElse(result) // This also returns a promise, so we can chain another thenable\n  })\n  .then(function(newResult){\n      return printNewResult(newResult)\n  })\n  .catch(function(failure){\n      return failure\n  })\n\n// Much neater in ES6\ndoSomething()\n  .then(result => doSomethingElse(result))\n  .then(newResult => printNewResult(newResult))\n  .catch(failure => failure)\n\nFetch and Axios\nThe Fetch API is a built-in javascript interface for fetching resources (including across the network).\nIt has a relatively simple syntax and it uses Promises to handle results/callbacks.\nThe syntax looks like this: fetch(URL(required), options(optional)).then(response).catch(error).\nSo fetch sends a request to an url to retrieve data from, and optionally some options, such as method (GET,POST,...). It will return a response which can be handled in the then statement.\nLet's make a request to an API. Introducing the Random People API!!\nfetch(\"https://randomuser.me/api/\")\n  .then(response => response.json()) // wil return JSON so let's parse that\n  .then(data => console.log(data)) // let's examine what this returns\n\n// I only want the name:\n\nfetch(\"https://randomuser.me/api/\")\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => alert(data.results[0].name.first + \" \" + data.results[0].name.last))\n\nAxios is a third-party Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios is NOT built-in, so that means we need to import that somehow (more about that in the NPM and module.export sections).\nThe same code in axios would look like this:\naxios.get(\"https://randomuser.me/api/\")\n.then(response => response.json())\n.then(data => alert(data.results[0].name.first + \" \" + data.results[0].name.last))\n\nExercises\nNeed to create some exercises using API requests and promises\nProject\nLink to Project: https://github.com/jankeLearning/projects/tree/master/04-twitz\nExternal Resources\n\nFrom the people at Google: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises\nFor dummies: https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies\nFetch API: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch\nAxios: https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios\nyou get the gist: https://gist.github.com/domenic/3889970\nlearning promises  \na sick github of examples  \na library to help with async programming.  \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\nhttps://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies\nhttp://www.telerik.com/blogs/what-is-the-point-of-promises\nhttps://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261  \nvideo from flo\n\n"},"javascript/tricky-things.html":{"url":"javascript/tricky-things.html","title":"Tricky Things","keywords":"","body":"Tricky JavaScript\nStrict equality\nIn JS you can compare if two variables are equal by using either two equal (==) signs or three (===). So what's the difference? In most cases you won't have to worry about the difference, but for good practice it is recommended to use strict equality (===) by default.\nStrict Equality compares the values AND their datatypes for equality.\nLet's say I have two variables: var a = 2 and var b = \"2\". \nAs you can see var a is number, while var b is a string. They are both different datatypes, however, var b can be interpreted as a number.\nWhat would happen if we use Strict Equality and what if we don't?\nWithout strict equality the statement a == b will return true. Javascript will only check the values of the variables and ignore the datatype.\nMost of the times we don't want this to be true and we want to check for datatype as well. That's why we use Strict Equality: a === b will return false\nNull does not mean 0\nYou may be tempted to think the null keyword to mean 0, however you would be mistaken. Null simply means 'Empty', no value. So you wouldn't be able to do any arithmetical operations with a variable evaluating as null.\nTruthy and falsy values\nBooleans can sometimes be hard to grasp and I would recommend everyone to spend ample amount of time studying it.\nA Boolean primitive can be true or false. However there are also values that will be evaluated as such even if they're not Boolean primitives.\nLet's run the following statements in your browser:\nconsole.log(0 == false);\nconsole.log(null == undefined);\nconsole.log('' == 0);\nconsole.log({} == true);\nconsole.log([] == true);\n\nAll of the above will evaluate as true!\n0, '' (empty string), null, undefined, ... are so called falsy values and will always return as false. This can be useful if you want to check if a variable is empty or not:\nvar myString = \"some string\";\n// some code\nif (myString){  // if myString would be '' this would evaluate as false and this code would not run. In any other case the code would run\n    // do something\n}\n\nBut the last two examples (the empty array and empty object) are truthy despite being empty, why is that? Both {} and [] are in fact objects and any object will be coerced to a boolean value of true in JavaScript.\nisNaN(9) is false\nA common mistake is when checking for numbers is using a number as an argument for the \"Is Not a Number\" method. 9 is in fact a number so this will return false. In this case you would need: \"Is not Not a Number\", which you can achieve by putting an exclamation mark before isNaN.\nvar, let, const and scope\nSince ES6 there are two new ways to declare a variable: let and const. So what's the difference with good old var? \nWell, the difference lies in the scope. \nLet's try something out. Let's say we have this simple loop:\nfor (var i = 0; i \nWhat do you think i will be in the second console.log? \nIf you said 10, you're correct. Let's break this down. We want a loop to run as long as i is less than 10, so that means excluding 10. The loop will run and will print out: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nHowever, after the loop has finished we ask for the value of i again. This time it will return 10. Before the loop prints out the value of i it evaluates if the condition has been met ( is i less than 10). So when i becomes 10, the condition evaluates as false and the loop ends. However, i == 10 remains in memory!\nThis is called variable hoisting.\nYou might think that i only exists inside the loop block, but that's not the case. Whenever or wherever var has been declared, it will be hoisted to the top of the global code or the function code.\nTo avoid this behavior, let and const have been invented. The same code with let will now throw an error after the second console.log:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nLet and const are block scope variables, which means they only exist in the block within they have been declared. In this case, i will only exist inside the loop block.\nIdentical objects are not the same\nvar obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};\nvar obj2 = {a: 1, b: 2};\n\nvar obj3 = obj1;\n\nIf you would compare obj1 to obj2 you'd probably expect Javascript to tell you these are the same. Only, they're not... Separately declared objects, even when their key-value pairs are identical, refer to different addresses in memory. So as far as JS is concerned, these are two different variables.\nHowever, when you use assignment you also duplicate the pointer to the memory block. That's why evaluating obj3 === obj1 will return as true.\nNot too deep cloning\nYou can use the Object.assign(object) to make a clone of an existing object. This could be particularly useful to make sure you're not by accident manipulating the existing object, with nasty bugs as result.\nHowever, this method only goes so far...\nvar obj4 = {a: 1, b : {c : 2}};\nvar obj5 = Object.assign({}, obj4);\n\nobj4 === obj5 // will return false\nobj5.b.c++;\nconsole.log(obj4.b) // will now return {c: 3}!!!\n\nSo Object.assign makes a clone of a object with its enumerables and its properties. However, nested objects have their own addresses in memory. So even after cloning, the nested objects are still pointing to the same address of the original one.\nExternal resources\nHere you'll find some resources about some more trickier concepts regarding JavaScript. \n\nhttp://javascript.info/javascript-specials\n\nhttp://www.thatjsdude.com\n\nhttps://www.toptal.com/javascript/10-most-common-javascript-mistakes\n\nhttps://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/\n\nhttp://www.thatjsdude.com/interview/js2.html\n\nhttps://wtfjs.com\n\nif you have programming experience : http://spencertipping.com/js-in-ten-minutes/js-in-ten-minutes.pdf\n\nObject coersion\n\n\n"},"javascript/dom.html":{"url":"javascript/dom.html","title":"DOM","keywords":"","body":"The DOM and JS\nLecture about the DOM: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13ir7s_Ll8cE6SgT4ub9SMcSHLRhPYPjcQLNxBuuZ69g/edit#slide=id.g1d1e49e639_0_5\nBasic DOM manipulation\nGo through chapter 2 - 4 from this github page\nAfter finishing these chapters you should have a basic grasp of traversing through and manipulating the DOM.\nExternal Resources\n\nW3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp\nYou don't need JQuery: https://github.com/oneuijs/You-Dont-Need-jQuery\nBut if you really want to: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery\n\n\nDOM 2\nThe DOM is far more than just div elements.

We do expect you to use CSS or a framework like Bootstrap in all your projects. It's not enough to have an app or website functionally working, it also has to look pretty to the user.\nResponsive Web Design\nResponsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.\nThe practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.\nFrameworks\nI would recommend starting with Bootstrap. It's easy to understand and use and adheres to the Responsive Design and Mobile First paradigm.\nOptionally you can look into Semantic-UI or Materialize, but only if you feel comfortable enough designing websites with CSS.\nExternal Resources\nThere are some great resources out there to learn CSS.

It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.\nThe DOM is a programming API for documents. It is based on an object structure that closely resembles the structure of the documents it models. For instance, consider this table, taken from an HTML document:\n      \n       \n       \n      Shady Grove\n      Aeolian \n       \n      \n      Over the river, Charlie        \n      Dorian \n       \n      \n      \n\nA graphical representation of the DOM of the example table is:\n\nJS Runtime\nA page does not just get rendered, but is read from top to bottom; as it reads the browser tries to load execute and read all the external js, css, images and video.\nA JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.\nTo execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:\n\nonclick=JavaScript\n\nExamples of HTML events:\n\nWhen a user clicks the mouse\nWhen a web page has loaded\nWhen an image has been loaded\nWhen the mouse moves over an element\nWhen an input field is changed\nWhen an HTML form is submitted\nWhen a user strokes a key\n\nIn this example, the content of the  element is changed when a user clicks on it:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on this text!\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP\nWe'll let Harvard explain it... \nhttp://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/http/http-720p.mp4\nExternal Resources\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_events.asp\nHow does the internet work:\npart 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ\npart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAPjr7vgxE\n\n\nEverything - http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm#The_main_flow\n\nDeveloper Tools\nWhat are developer tools?\nAll of the most popular modern web browsers include a suite of tools designed to help with the development of websites; they are also sometimes referred to as the web inspector. These tools allow you to inspect the html, css, javascript and much more on websites you visit and build.\nWhy do you need to know how to use them?\nKnowing how to use your browsers developer tools is an indispensable skill for a web developer. They allow you to easily and quickly track down the cause of issues and bugs like problems with layout or other css hiccups. What might have taken an hour or even a few hours to track down and fix without the use of these tools often takes a matter of minutes or even seconds with the help of developer tools.\nAlthough they offer you so many useful capabilities, learning how to use the developer tools isn't that difficult. It can feel clunky the first few times you use them.

GIT and Github allows you to protect your code against silly mistakes, organize, and document your code so others know how to use it and what to use it for.\n\nWhat's GIT ?\n\nGit is a command-line application that allows you to travel through time.  Every commit saves a complete image of your directory structure at the time of commiting (actually your staged directory structure, but whatever for now). \nGit allows you to create alternative universes.  With branches you can save two copies of the same directory that differ by a single file/method/bug/...  This is very practical for testing experimental features, fixing bugs, or sharing work across a group.\nGit allows you to commune with parallel dimensions.  'Pull' and 'push' allows your local git commit tree to synchronize with a git tree located anywhere on the internet.  This is how you will use GitHub and how multiple people are able to collaborate on the same codebase.\n\nGit has more tricks up it's sleeves, but these 3 will carry farther than you can see without awakening your third eye.\nWhat's GitHub ?\ntl;dr - it can be anything you need it to be.  \nWe'll be discussing the following uses in this course:\n\nRemote hosting for Git repositories.  With pushing and pulling, you can use GitHub to back up your work.  If you stop there, you're a fool. GitHub can do so much more for you.\nPersonal portfolio. GitHub has built-in tools for hosting static pages. With a little ingenuity this can be used to build a pretty sick portfolio that's fully integrated with your GitHub account.\n\nThese are for you to explore on your own:\n\nSocial network and linkedin for developers.\nProject hosting and project management.\nAn infinite library of useful code to study or use. \nInteractive documentation.\nIntegrator with many apps - we've used sketchboard.io's integration.\n\n\nWe've created this curriculum entirely on GitHub relying mostly on these features: github pages, organizations, issues, repo hosting, and projects.\n\nHow does this all fit together ?\n\nGit is like a really epic save button for your files and directories - officially Git is called a version control system.\nTo compare, a save in a text editor would record all of the words of a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file like essay.doc unless you make duplicate copies (which would be difficult to remember to do and keep track of):\nessay-draft1.doc, essay-draft2.doc, essay-final.doc\nA save in Git however, would record differences of files and folders AND keep a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub for sharing and collaborating with other developers.\nWhile Git works on your local machine, GitHub is a remote storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider the ability to use Git as an essential skill for a modern web developer to have; having a portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.\nIn the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why Git is so useful.\nAnd finally, you will set up a project with Git and this will serve as a template for setting up your future projects.\nLearning Outcome:\nBy the end of this lesson you should be able to:\n\nDefine what kind of program Git is\nDescribe the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping\nDescribe whether Git and GitHub work at a local or remote level\nDescribe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers    \n\n\nSSH keys\na how and why to article\n\nStudy resources:\n\nGit and Github in plain English.

Navigable and helpful GitHub repositories are finished projects. Fortunately git provides all the tools necessary to organize your code in a developer-friendly way and GitHub provides a great interface for exploring well-organized projects.\nBuilding a good repo is a little tricky and will take some practice.  It requires careful planning and extra attention through your development process.  At the end you will have something that looks like this: A complete repository.\n\nWhat makes a good repo?\nYou will begin implementing these features in week 1 project:\n\nAn informative README\nVersion tags - versions are fully functional releases, they can be downloaded and run without crashing.\nBranches - gh-pages branch, master release branch. \ngh-pages demo\n*tests - for now, simple hand-build testing suites\n\nLater in the course we will discuss how to use these features in a repo:\n\ndocumentation - wiki, gh-pages, markdown.  There are many ways to do this\nFull testing suites\nContributing guidelines - ideas for contributors, code of conduct, ...\nGithub projects - for organizing collaborative directly in the repo\nPull requests and issues\n\nThis lesson is the first in a series of lessons that will cover how to use GitHub to organize your entire development process.

However, it's best practice to save files purposefully; we call this an atomic commit.\nIf we were to add all the files onto one stage and not think about making atomic commits, this would make your snapshot really crowded and congested - this is bad for two reasons:\nFirst, you will not know why the snapshot was meaningful and if you wanted to find a specific snapshot you would find it difficult to trace what you were trying to accomplish with those files.\nSecond, imagine if your project got corrupted or your code has a bug you can't figure out and does not work anymore. If you were to put all your files onto one stage and then tried to load a previous snapshot known to be stable, you would lose a lot of progress with your work and then piecing all the files back to their desired state would be painstaking.\nTo get around this, only git add files that are thematically similar. For example if your project had a lot of text files and image files, you could stage all text files together for one snapshot and then all image files together for another snapshot.\nAll snapshots taken must have a message attached to it. When you have staged files purposefully (or with a theme), it's easy to decide what kind of message to include.\nTo take a snapshot, you would run git commit -m \"Initial commit\". The -m flag stands for message and then you include your short message in between the quotation marks: \"Initial commit\".\n\nMore about writing atomic commits\n\n"},"developer-tools/wireframes.html":{"url":"developer-tools/wireframes.html","title":"Wireframes","keywords":"","body":"Wireframes\nWireframes are a very simple idea: Draw your website before you code it.

Many cloud hosts (Heroku, Azure, AWS, now.sh, etc.) and Node.js modules use environment variables. Hosts, for example, will set a PORT variable that specifies on which port the server should listen to properly work. Modules might have different behaviors (like logging) depending on the value of NODE_ENV variable.\nAccessing environment variables in Node.js is supported right out of the box. When your Node.js process boots up it will automatically provide access to all existing environment variables by creating an env object as property of the process global object. If you want to take a peek at the object run a console.log in your node app:\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n    console.log(\"App is running with \" + process.env)\n})\n\nThis code should output all environment variables that this Node.js process is aware of. To access one specific variable, access it like any property of an object:\nconsole.log(\"Server is listening on port \" + process.env.PORT)\n\nYou should see that the value of port is undefined on your computer. Cloud hosts like Heroku or Azure, however, use the PORT variable to tell you on which port your server should listen for the routing to work properly. Therefore, the next time you set up a web server, you should determine the port to listen on by checking PORT first and giving it a default value otherwise:\nvar PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}` );\n})\n\nThe console.log will display the value of PORT if available or 3000 by default.\nLoading variables dev vs prod\nan articleour exampleanother article  \n"},"developer-tools/documenting-projects.html":{"url":"developer-tools/documenting-projects.html","title":"Documenting Projects","keywords":"","body":"http://jsdox.org + shell scripts -> wiki\nhttps://github.com/cbou/markdox\nhttp://documentation.js.org\nhttps://github.com/documentationjs/documentation\nhttps://doxdox.org\nhttps://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs - for reading pleasure\nhttps://guides.github.com/features/wikis/\nthis will be a series of files outlining how to make your code readable (documented)\nthere will be several folders within it\n    readable code at syntax level\n        pros\n        variable names\n        organizatoin in a file\n        algorithmic choices\n        ...\n    comenting\n        pros/cons\n        refer to 218.  something about it not saying what the code does\n    organizing projects\n        modular/elegent vs debuggable readable\n        useful file/folder names\n        organzation demonstrates functional divisons\n    documenting\n        book-style\n        premptive vs reactive\nthis will also be presented as several lectures\nreadme, pages, wiki, ...\nbook-style documentation\ndocumentation isn't you remembering how your code works.  it's you teaching how your code works\nhttps://readthedocs.org\n"},"developer-tools/postman.html":{"url":"developer-tools/postman.html","title":"Postman","keywords":"","body":"Testing apps without the frontend\nA great way of testing API's without going to the hassle of writing code, is using an application called Postman. Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API's functionality.\n\nDownload it here\n\nLet's go back to the random user generator api example. Instead of writing out a whole new route and function to perform the request, then I would have to specify with more code what I want the response to look like, and finally I would have to print out the response to the console or provide some other way of actually viewing the response. Granted, I would probably need to write all this out anyway to make a functioning app using this API, but doing all this to simply test an API's functionality is unnecessarily tedious and time consuming when something like Postman exists.\nWith Postman, such a test is much more streamlined. All I have to do is plug the route into the address bar, select the GET response method on the dropdown box to its left, specify that I want the response in “pretty” JSON format, and hit send. Then, I get the response data in easy-to-read JSON with a status code of 200, confirming the GET request was successful. It’s that simple!\nPostman let's you also add headers. Let's say we want to make use of the Google Maps API, for which we need an API key. We could then simply add this api key as a header and hit send. \nForms and post requests\nWe could also use Postman to test post requests (sending data to the api), actually Postman supports all HTTP requests, but we'll focus on post here.\nTesting a post request isn't that complicated. You first select the POST method instead of GET. You'll notice that you now have access to the body of the request. Here you'll have to define the format with which the data will be sent. If you're planning to use HTML forms (for example user registration), you'll need to select the x-www-form-urlencoded option. This will make it possible to send key-value pairs to the api. If it works, you should then get some kind of success message.\n"},"application-design/":{"url":"application-design/","title":"Application Design","keywords":"","body":"building good software.apps = Data + user interaction\n\n\n\n"},"application-design/user-centered-development.html":{"url":"application-design/user-centered-development.html","title":"User-Centered Development","keywords":"","body":"user-centered-development.md\n"},"application-design/data-modeling.html":{"url":"application-design/data-modeling.html","title":"Data Modeling","keywords":"","body":"Data Modeling 1\nNow that you're separating your apps into MVC you need to store your data separately from everything else.  Your data doesn't need to be stored anything like how it's displayed, it's the view object's responsibilty to make sure our data is readable.  This leaves you free to organize our data however you want; arrays, objects, variables, data-objects, you name it.\nAfter you become comfortable with the idea of a decoupled view and data store, you have much more liberty in designing your apps.  You also have a whole new set of decisions to make - how to organize, store, and retrieve your data.\n\nWho Uses Your Data For What?\n\nApps = Data + Interaction\n\nAfter you are clear on what data your application needs, the first 2 questions you should ask yourself are ...\n\nWhat interactions will my model need to support? \nWhat's the simplest possible way to implement those interactions?\n\nOnly after you can answer these questions should you begin writing your data model.\nThe backbone of your application is the model.  If the model is inefficient your app will be slow. Ff your data is stored in a convoluted way your view will be diffcult to write. If the model isn't logicial other people will have diffculty understanding what your app is for. \nData modeling is a gigantic topic, you could make a career out of it.  We will be exploring it in more detail with later lessons and projects.  For now stick to these two questions as you begin to develop an intuition for good data practices.\nAs you work your way through the tictactoe and battleship projects either look at the code we provide you or the code you're writing and ask yourself - What's happening from the data's point of view?

Fielding used REST to design HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). The term is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: it is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting links, such as /user/tom, and operations such as GET or DELETE (state transitions), resulting in the next resource (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user for their use.\nWeb service APIs that adhere to the REST architectural constraints are called RESTful APIs. HTTP-based RESTful APIs are defined with the following aspects:\n\nbase URL, such as http://api.example.com/resources/\nan internet media type that defines state transition data elements (e.g., Atom, microformats, application/vnd.collection+json, etc.) The current representation tells the client how to compose requests for transitions to all the next available application states. This could be as simple as a URL or as complex as a Java applet.\nstandard HTTP methods (e.g., OPTIONS, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE)\n\nRelationship between URL and HTTP methods\nThe following table shows how HTTP methods are typically used in a RESTful API:\n\nHTTP methods\n\n\nUniform Resource Locator (URL)\nGET\nPUT\nPATCH    \nPOST    \nDELETE\n\n\n\n\nCollection, such as https://api.example.com/resources/    \n List the URIs and perhaps other details of the collection's members.\n Replace the entire collection with another collection.    \nNot generally used    \nCreate a new entry in the collection. The new entry's URI is assigned automatically and is usually returned by the operation.    \nDelete the entire collection.\n\n\nElement, such as https://api.example.com/resources/item17\nRetrieve a representation of the addressed member of the collection, expressed in an appropriate Internet media type.\nReplace the addressed member of the collection, or if it does not exist, create it.\nUpdate the addressed member of the collection.\nNot generally used. Treat the addressed member as a collection in its own right and create a new entry within it.    \nDelete the addressed member of the collection.\n\n\n\nCRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete\nRESTful routing should in most cases follow the CRUD architecture, i.e different routes that handles listing, creating, updating and deleting data.\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar app = express();\nvar db = usersDb;\n\n/* CREATE */\n\napp.post(\"/add\", (req, res) => {\n    // add a user to the db\n})\n\n/* READ */\n\napp.get(\"/users\", (req, res) => {\n    // List all users in the database\n})\n\n/* UPDATE */\n\napp.put(\"/user/15461\", (req, res) => {\n    // update user with id 15461\n})\n\n/* DELETE */\napp.delete(\"/user/15461/delete\", (req, res) => {\n    // delete user 15461\n})\n\nExternal Resources\n\nScotch.io tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4\nBest practices: https://blog.risingstack.com/10-best-practices-for-writing-node-js-rest-apis/  \nSimple RESTFUL example: https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-code/tree/master/Week%2005-6/1-simply-cruddy-to-read  \n\nSource\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\nhttp://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#requirements \n\n\n\n"},"application-design/data-relationships.html":{"url":"application-design/data-relationships.html","title":"Data Relationships","keywords":"","body":"much good stuff in starbook project assignment\nData Modeling 2\nThe last lesson on data modeling got you thinking about how users will interact with your data and the possiblity of storing your data differently to facilitate different interactions.\nThis lesson introduces the principle types of interactions that data will have within itself.

Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages.\"\nWhat is a document-oriented database?\nA document-oriented database, or document store, is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data.\nDocument databases contrast strongly with the traditional relational database (RDB). Relational databases generally store data in separate tables that are defined by the programmer, and a single object may be spread across several tables. Document databases store all information for a given object in a single instance in the database, and every stored object can be different from every other. This makes mapping objects into the database a simple task, normally eliminating anything similar to an object-relational mapping. This makes document stores attractive for programming web applications, which are subject to continual change in place, and where speed of deployment is an important issue\nHow to install MongoDb locally?\nDownload the Community Server version for your Operating System.\nInstructions for Windows users\nFollow these instructions for the docs.\nInstructions for Mac users\nFollow these instructions or install with HomeBrew.\nUsing mLab\nYou can also create a MongoDb instance remotely on mlab.

It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.\nIn simple words, Mongoose acts as an intermediate between mongodb and server side language(like NodeJs). \nInstalling Mongoose\nMongoose is a NPM-package, so you just need to npm install it in your project and require it.\nnpm install --save mongoose\nvar mongoose = require(mongoose);\n\nConnecting to MongDB\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/db_name', {\n  useMongoClient: true\n})\n\nMongoose has a \"connect\" method that takes the path to the mongoDb instance as the first argument. Here you link to an existing database. If the database doesn't exist yet, if will be dynamically created by mongoose.\n\nThe second parameter gets rid of an annoying warning message everything you start your application.\n\nWhen using mLab you'll also have to enter a username and password. You should find the link in your database profile in your account.\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://:@ds119533.mlab.com:19533/db_name', {\n    useMongoClient: true\n})\n\nSimple Crud\nCreating a Schema\nThe database schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term \"schema\" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema.\nA simple schema example:\nvar mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\nvar Schema = mongoose.Schema;\n\nvar UserSchema = Schema({\n  first_name: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  last_name: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  age: {type: Number}\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  }\n})\n\nvar User = mongoose.model(\"User\", UserSchema);\n\nAbove we've created a schema for storing user objects. We define 4 properties (first_name, last_name, username and password ) and add some integrity constraints (datatype, required, unique).\nWe then create a model based on the created schema.\n\nIt's important to note that it's not necessary to define an ID property. Mongoose/MongoDb automatically creates an unique ID.\n\nStoring a document\nThe model can then be used to store documents based on the defined schema. Let's say we retrieve a user object through a form input:\nvar userObj = {\n  first_name: \"Rien\",\n  last_name: \"Cosyns\",\n  age: 29,\n  username: \"riebow\",\n  password: \"G##@83r4r4f5!@$T^\" \n}\n\nUser.save(userObj, (err, record) => {\n  if (err){\n    console.log(err);\n  } else {\n    console.log(record);\n  }\n})\n\nWe can use the .save method to store the user object in the database.\nFinding a document\nvar username = {username: \"riebow\"};\nUser.findOne(username, (error, existingUser) => {\n  if (error){\n    console.log(error);\n  } else if (!existingUser){\n    console.log(\"No such user\");\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"User found: \" + existingUser);\n  } \n})\n\nYou can find exactly one document with .findOne method. If you want to retrieve multiple documents, you can use the .find method. Probably the best way to find a specific entry is to use the .findById method. which retrieves the document based on the ID.\nUpdating a document\nvar username = {username: \"riebow\"};\nvar query = {age: 30};\n\nUser.findOneAndUpdate(username, query, (error, updatedUser) => {\n  if (error) return false;\n  return updatedUser\n})\n\nDeleting a document\nvar username = {username: \"riebow\"}\nUser.findOneAndDelete(username, (err) => {\n  if (err) return false;\n  console.log(\"User deleted\"); \n})\n\nSuper basic Mongoose app\nExternal resources\nMongoose 2: many-to-many relationships\nTypes of relationships\nA type of relationship where two entities are solely linked to each other, e.g a country has only one capital city, and a capital city is the capital of only one country, is called a one-to-one relationship. An element of A may only be linked to one element of B, and vice versa.\nIf an element of A can only be linked to one element of B, but B can be linked to many elements of A, this is called one-to-many relationships. For example, a child has only one biological mother, but the mother can have multiple children.\nFinally, when elements of both A and B can be linked to multiple elements of each other, we call this a many-to-many relationship. For example, an author can write many books, and a book can have multiple authors.\n.populate method\nPopulation is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s). We may populate a single document, multiple documents, plain object, multiple plain objects, or all objects returned from a query. Let's look at some examples.\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose');\nvar Schema = mongoose.Schema;\n\nvar personSchema = Schema({\n  _id: Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n  name: String,\n  age: Number,\n  stories: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Story' }]\n});\n\nvar storySchema = Schema({\n  author: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Person' },\n  title: String,\n  fans: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Person' }]\n});\n\nvar Story = mongoose.model('Story', storySchema);\nvar Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);\n\nSo far we've created two Models. Our Person model has its stories field set to an array of ObjectIds. The ref option is what tells Mongoose which model to use during population, in our case the Story model. All _ids we store here must be document _ids from the Story model.\nSaving refs\nSaving refs to other documents works the same way you normally save properties, just assign the _id value:\nvar author = new Person({\n  _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\n  name: 'Ian Fleming',\n  age: 50\n});\n\nauthor.save(function (err) {\n  if (err) return handleError(err);\n\n  var story1 = new Story({\n    title: 'Casino Royale',\n    author: author._id    // assign the _id from the person\n  });\n\n  story1.save(function (err) {\n    if (err) return handleError(err);\n    // thats it!\n  });\n});\n\nPopulation\nSo far we haven't done anything much different. We've merely created a Person and a Story. Now let's take a look at populating our story's author using the query builder:\nStory.\n  findOne({ title: 'Casino Royale' }).\n  populate('author').\n  exec(function (err, story) {\n    if (err) return handleError(err);\n    console.log('The author is %s', story.creator.name);\n    // prints \"The author is Ian Fleming\"\n  });\n\nPopulated paths are no longer set to their original _id , their value is replaced with the mongoose document returned from the database by performing a separate query before returning the results.\nProject\nLink to project.\n\nMongoose playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGquJ_T_JBMQ1C0Pp41sykceli8G1UGtg\n\n\n\n\n"},"core-libraries/passport.html":{"url":"core-libraries/passport.html","title":"Passport","keywords":"","body":"Passport-local\nPassport strategy for authenticating with a username and password.\nThis module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications.

The word is made up of many letters, and each pair letter will need to be reversed.\n\n\nAre those subtasks all pretty much identical?\nYES!  Reversing two letters is the same no matter which two letters they are.\n\n\n\nCleared for take off -->\n\nBreaking down the problem\nLet's ask some questions to start off our recursive solution:\n\nWhat is the simplest sub-task that composes my main goal?\nReversing chunks of letters that make up the word. \n\n\nWhat’s the smallest component (base case) on which I can perform this task?\nEither a pair of single letters OR one letter and an 'empty letter' (undefined) - depending on if a word (or fragment of a word) is even or odd.\n\n\nHow do I break the large component into smaller ones?\nSplit the word in half.\n\n\nHow do I know when I’m at the smallest component (base case)?\nUse conditional checks to see if your current argument looks like any of these:\nletter+undefined \nundefined+letter\nletter+letter\n\n\n\n\nHow do I rebuild my smaller solutions back into my final solution?\nReverse them and concatinate them.  \nReturn the new string so the previous recursive call can do the same with this substring and it's buddy.\n\n\n\nSo what do these answers mean?  When figuring out tricky algorithms it's best to pick a specific example and visually work it through by hand.\n\nVisualizing the Solution\nBelow is a diagram that takes an example argument 'mattress' and illustrates the recursive solution indicated by our answers to the above questions.  \n\n\nMini Quiz: Can you guess why this example uses an 8 letter word?\n\nCode for the Diagram\nFunctions like the simple examples at the top of the page can only break down the input, they can't reconstruct a final solution out of the smaller pieces.  Add in a return statement and your recursive functions become much more powerful.  You can now construct larger solutions out of the smaller pieces.\nIn this example the smaller pieces are individual letters that have been reversed and the larger solution is a whole word that has been reversed.  \nfunction recursion_starter(word) {\n    // this function exists so you can pass in whole words.\n    //   why is a starter necessary?\n    var first_half = word.slice(0, word.length/2);\n    var second_half = word.slice(word.length/2);\n    return word_reverser(first_half, second_half);\n};\n\nvar word_reverser = function recurse(first_half, second_half) {\n    // identify base cases -\n    //      If you have a base case, perform your operation and return the result\n    if ((first_half == undefined)) {\n        return second_half; \n    } else if ((second_half == undefined)) {\n        return first_half; \n    } else if ((first_half.length == 1) && (second_half.length == 1)) {\n        return second_half + first_half; \n    } // if no basecases are met, move closer to a basecase\n    else {\n        var second_1 = second_half.slice(0, second_half.length/2);\n        var second_2 = second_half.slice(second_half.length/2);\n        var first_1 = first_half.slice(0, first_half.length/2);\n        var first_2 = first_half.slice(first_half.length/2);\n        // notice 'second' is first, and 'first' is second.\n        return recurse(second_1, second_2) + recurse(first_1, first_2);\n    };\n};\n\nconsole.log(recursion_starter('mattress'));\n\nStudy Tip: \n\nRun this code in Loupe to watch how JS keeps track of the many recursive calls.\nPlace 'console.log's or 'debugger's throught the method to see the intermediate steps from the diagram.\n\nChallenge: Can you figure out how to replace the recursive calls with a 'while' loop?\nExtra Challengy Challenge: This function is not very efficient, it uses what is called tail end recursion.

Each one comes with empty code and a little bit of instruction.  \n\nStack: \nFirst in, last out.\n\n\nQueue:\nFirst in, First out.\n\n\nLinked List:\nCan only look forward in line.\n\n\nDoubly Linked List:\nCan look forward or backwards in line.\n\n\nBinary Search Tree:\nAlways knows which way to turn.\n\n\nComplete Tree: \nVery little guidance.\n\n\n\nYou can find the starter code here\n\nAdditional Challenge\nRefactor your MEGAMODEL to store data in one of these data structures. Don't forget to implement a Search method!\n\nResources\n\nbetter than i can do\nSome examples for this project  \nexamples, this project and beyond  \nitsy bitsy  \nBuckets, a giant library\nGoogle it\n\n"},"in-the-wild/":{"url":"in-the-wild/","title":"In The Wild","keywords":"","body":"what you need to know to find the right career\n"},"in-the-wild/interview-preparation.html":{"url":"in-the-wild/interview-preparation.html","title":"Interview Preparation","keywords":"","body":"https://tests4geeks.com/javascript/?utm_campaign=quora&utm_content=what-are-some-good-javascript-interview-questions&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=quora.com&fref=gc\n"},"in-the-wild/open-source-contributing.html":{"url":"in-the-wild/open-source-contributing.html","title":"Open-Source Contributing","keywords":"","body":"a guide to finding projects and being helpful\nhttps://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/6vprbf/how_to_make_your_first_steps_in_open_source/\n"}}}
