Problem Solving\nOne of the most important skills you can learn to become a 10x developer is to write exactly and only the simplest code necessary.  This skill is much harder to learn and much more valuable than being able to write cool applications or being able to code challenging algorithms.\nThis lesson is a small practical guide this skill.  For a look at the bigger picture of why this is so valuable, check out this post on our blog.\nIndex\n\nconstraints   \nanalysis first\ndecomposition\ncommon constraints  \ncollaboration process  \nstudying like this \nresources\n\n\nConstraints\nConstraints force you to commit to one path and follow it through.  They force you to think creatively in order to work around them.  They force you to focus your energies onto a smaller set of possible solutions. Adding constraints improves and accelerates creative problem solving.\nIt may sound intuitively wrong, but the fewer restrictions you have on your work the more difficult it is to be creative.  One of the crucial skills you need to learn is when and how to place restrictions on yourself.  \nSpecs are a perfect example of self-imposed constraints that help enormously in producing a final product.  Without the structure of agreed-upon specs you would have to spend much more of your time remembering what you're doing and how it fits with the last piece you built.  \nOn the group level, specs are indispensible.  Without agreeing on specs before beginning to code, it's almost guarenteed that your team's code will not work when you piece it together.  By constraining yourselves to a set of specs, you are free as a group to take more liberties in implementation and workflow with the confidence that your project will work when everyone has finished their piece.\nTOP\n\nAnalysis First\nWhen presented with a new problem, it is a waste of time to start by trying to solve it.  The moment you begin thinking of solutions, you limit your energies to debating or improving the proposed solutions rather than looking for new perspectives on the problem.\nBefore even considering solutions, you should spend more time than you want to conidering the problem from every angle. This is also not intuitive, but a crucial skill to understand and practice.\nAs a developer, you are very rarely solving a problem that has been exactly solved before (or you'd be using someone else's code).  You will rarely have much guidance.  You will often have have a lot of freedom in coming up with your solution.  This is not the best situation for creative problem solving.\nYou must manage your time and your patience to maximize your efforts.  By spending extra time understading the problem then even more selecting the correct constraints for yourself, you will be saving yourself and your team time in the future.\n\n“Given one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem and 5 minutes finding the solution.” ~ Albert Einstein\n\nTOP\n\nCommon Constraints\nThis list is long and it's not even near comprehensive.  Rather than looking it as an enormous list of shutdowns, try thinking of it as a bunch of decisions you don't have to make.  Free yourself!\nSome common constraints when developing software:\n\nThe audiences:\nA user must understand your applicaiton.\nDevelopers must understand your code.\nComputers must run your code.\n\n\nOther people\nBad legacy code\nUnpleasant team-mates\nBad junior developers\nEven worse senior developers\nBad managers\nImpossible customers\n\n\nYourself\nSkill/experience limitations\nTool familiarity\nBad work habits\nBad attitude\nPoor team-working skills\n\n\nDevelopment\nDeadlines\nBudgets\nSpecs\nUnexpected changes in any of these\nArchitecture \n\n\nTechnology stacks:\nProgramming languages\nFrameworks \nLack of frameworks\nCompatibility\n\n\nHardware, yours and users:\nSpeed\nPrice\nOS\n\n\nAnd so so many more ...\n\nTOP\n\nDecomposition\nProblem decomposition is central to problem solving.  Being able to look at a large problem and understand it as many small problems strung together will make you a better human.  \nSome of many advantages:      \n\nYou have created helpful constraints.  Two smaller problems are easier to approach and will usually result in a higher quality finished product.  \nCollaboration becomes easier. You can split work with the guarentee that each person's contribution will be valuable.  \nIt can guide the analysis phase.  Often the hardest question is how to start understanding a problem. by first decomposing a new problem, you can skip being confused by how to start.  Decomposing is always worth your time.  \nSmaller pieces are easier to code.  Decomposing large problems brings them closer to code, making the trasition to a practical solution much simpler.  \nApps built of smaller apps are almost always easier to test and maintain.  \n\nI'm sure there are more benefits to breaking down large problems, but these should be enough to convince you.  \nGetting good at this will just take practice.    \nTOP\n\nCollaboration Process\nA procedure worth trying out with some friends:\n\nAnalyze and define the task all together\nBreak the problem into smaller pieces  \nAnalyze and define the smaller problems all together\nmake sure each smaller problem can be solved with code\nfigure out how the smaller problems can be fit together into a larger solution\ntry agreeing on some code specs for each small solution. If you do this well you should end up with what are basically a few well-documented libraries\n\n\nShare the smaller problems between yourselves, each person implementing their specs\nCreate stand-alone solutions to each smaller problem - ie. each of you create your own small library\nRequire the smaller solutions into one file and try stringing them together to build your full application.\nAssess, discuss, refactor.\n\nTOP\n\nResources\nConstraints:\n\nfrom medium, david\ncreative constraints\nFrom photography\ntypes of constraints\nwired, to sciency?\nforbes\n\nAnalysis First:\n\nProblem vs. Solution Oriented Thinking\nrockefeller\nanalysis paralysis\nA3\nmanaging to learn\ntriz\nlesswrong\n\nProblem Decomposition:\n\nBBC decomposition \nBBC algorithms\n\nArticles on studying like this:\n\nMakers 1\nMakers 2\n\nOther:\n\n1*x\n\n\n\n\n"},"key-resources/programming-paradigms.html":{"url":"key-resources/programming-paradigms.html","title":"Programming & Paradigms","keywords":"","body":"Programming Languages and Paradigms\nThis is a series of lessons that will get you started on your path to understanding programming from a meta point of view.  \n\nProgramming Languages and Paradigms\nObject Oriented Programming I\nObject Oriented Programming II\nFunctional Programming I\nOOP vs FP\nFunctional Programming II\n\nNo further ado, lettuce begin step 1.\n\nObject Oriented Programming is one of many paradigms that has grown to address the need for us to understand and generate algorithms.  Algorithms (or programs) are by their nature very abstract, and by the time they're actually being executed they're a string of 1's and 0's no matter what paradigm you use.  Somewhere between us wanting something to happen and the computer carrying out the task, there needs to be a middle ground we both understand. That middle ground is programming languages and programming paradigms.  \nProgramming Languages\nFrom the computer's side we have programming languages.  A programming language is designed from the bottom up to communicate with your computer - to compile to machine code and be executed.  At one conceptual end of a programming language is machine code, at the other is human-decipherable syntax.  JS for example. \nProgramming Paradigms\nFrom the human's side we have developed paradigms that rephrase algorithms into something we can begin to grasp with our intuitions.  \nIntuitions are created when we internalize the rules by which some system operates.  Humans have enormous capacity for intuition; you can ride bikes and drive cars without thinking, you can talk without planning every word, you can guess what others are thinking or feeling.  Unfortunatly for you there is very little in life that works anything like coding, so its rare to have strong intuitions for coding.  Some rare people just do have the right intuition, don't worry about them.  Every other good programmer has developed their intuition for programming by spending enough focused time to allow their brains to build an intuition. \nProgramming paradigms emerged to address this issue.  By thinking of algorithms as 'like x' you can understand them more effectively.  There are many paradigms out there, and each one has a host of programming languages that support their way of thinking: HTML fits a declarative paradigm, Java supports OOP, Haskal supports functional programming, Cat supports concatinative programming, ... The list is nearly endless and each one encourages programmers to think slightly differently. The best strategy depends on the person, the machine, and the need.\nJavaScript is a strange mutt, it natively supports much of what is needed for the most popular paradigms.  What it doesn't support natively, someone has probably written a library to implement.  As a student this puts you in a tricky position; You'll have to be extra diligent or you could slip very easily into very bad habits.

So what's the difference? In most cases you won't have to worry about the difference, but for good practice it is recommended to use strict equality (===) by default.\nStrict Equality compares the values AND their datatypes for equality.\nLet's say I have two variables: var a = 2 and var b = \"2\". \nAs you can see var a is number, while var b is a string. They are both different datatypes, however, var b can be interpreted as a number.\nWhat would happen if we use Strict Equality and what if we don't?\nWithout strict equality the statement a == b will return true. Javascript will only check the values of the variables and ignore the datatype.\nMost of the times we don't want this to be true and we want to check for datatype as well. That's why we use Strict Equality: a === b will return false\nNull does not mean 0\nYou may be tempted to think the null keyword to mean 0, however you would be mistaken. Null simply means 'Empty', no value. So you wouldn't be able to do any arithmetical operations with a variable evaluating as null.\nTruthy and falsy values\nBooleans can sometimes be hard to grasp and I would recommend everyone to spend ample amount of time studying it.\nA Boolean primitive can be true or false. However there are also values that will be evaluated as such even if they're not Boolean primitives.\nLet's run the following statements in your browser:\nconsole.log(0 == false);\nconsole.log(null == undefined);\nconsole.log('' == 0);\nconsole.log({} == true);\nconsole.log([] == true);\n\nAll of the above will evaluate as true!\n0, '' (empty string), null, undefined, ... are so called falsy values and will always return as false. This can be useful if you want to check if a variable is empty or not:\nvar myString = \"some string\";\n// some code\nif (myString){  // if myString would be '' this would evaluate as false and this code would not run. In any other case the code would run\n    // do something\n}\n\nBut the last two examples (the empty array and empty object) are truthy despite being empty, why is that? Both {} and [] are in fact objects and any object will be coerced to a boolean value of true in JavaScript.\nisNaN(9) is false\nA common mistake is when checking for numbers is using a number as an argument for the \"Is Not a Number\" method. 9 is in fact a number so this will return false. In this case you would need: \"Is not Not a Number\", which you can achieve by putting an exclamation mark before isNaN.\nvar, let, const and scope\nSince ES6 there are two new ways to declare a variable: let and const. So what's the difference with good old var? \nWell, the difference lies in the scope. \nLet's try something out. Let's say we have this simple loop:\nfor (var i = 0; i \nWhat do you think i will be in the second console.log? \nIf you said 10, you're correct. Let's break this down. We want a loop to run as long as i is less than 10, so that means excluding 10. The loop will run and will print out: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nHowever, after the loop has finished we ask for the value of i again. This time it will return 10. Before the loop prints out the value of i it evaluates if the condition has been met ( is i less than 10). So when i becomes 10, the condition evaluates as false and the loop ends. However, i == 10 remains in memory!\nThis is called variable hoisting.\nYou might think that i only exists inside the loop block, but that's not the case. Whenever or wherever var has been declared, it will be hoisted to the top of the global code or the function code.\nTo avoid this behavior, let and const have been invented. The same code with let will now throw an error after the second console.log:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nLet and const are block scope variables, which means they only exist in the block within they have been declared. In this case, i will only exist inside the loop block.\nIdentical objects are not the same\nvar obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};\nvar obj2 = {a: 1, b: 2};\n\nvar obj3 = obj1;\n\nIf you would compare obj1 to obj2 you'd probably expect Javascript to tell you these are the same. Only, they're not... Separately declared objects, even when their key-value pairs are identical, refer to different addresses in memory. So as far as JS is concerned, these are two different variables.\nHowever, when you use assignment you also duplicate the pointer to the memory block. That's why evaluating obj3 === obj1 will return as true.\nNot too deep cloning\nYou can use the Object.assign(object) to make a clone of an existing object. This could be particularly useful to make sure you're not by accident manipulating the existing object, with nasty bugs as result.\nHowever, this method only goes so far...\nvar obj4 = {a: 1, b : {c : 2}};\nvar obj5 = Object.assign({}, obj4);\n\nobj4 === obj5 // will return false\nobj5.b.c++;\nconsole.log(obj4.b) // will now return {c: 3}!!!\n\nSo Object.assign makes a clone of a object with its enumerables and its properties. However, nested objects have their own addresses in memory. So even after cloning, the nested objects are still pointing to the same address of the original one.\nExternal resources\nHere you'll find some resources about some more trickier concepts regarding JavaScript. \n\nhttp://javascript.info/javascript-specials\n\nhttp://www.thatjsdude.com\n\nhttps://www.toptal.com/javascript/10-most-common-javascript-mistakes\n\nhttps://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/\n\nhttp://www.thatjsdude.com/interview/js2.html\n\nhttps://wtfjs.com\n\nif you have programming experience : http://spencertipping.com/js-in-ten-minutes/js-in-ten-minutes.pdf\n\nObject coersion\n\n\n"},"css-html/":{"url":"css-html/","title":"CSS & HTML","keywords":"","body":"CSS & HTML are fundamental to web development.  super important.CSS is also much more powerful than people give it credit for.HTML5 has some great new utilities.\n"},"programming-resources/":{"url":"programming-resources/","title":"Programming Resources","keywords":"","body":"How to use code.  skills that transcend any specific language, framework, or environment\n"},"programming-resources/clean-code.html":{"url":"programming-resources/clean-code.html","title":"Clean Code","keywords":"","body":"Writing Readable Code\nDevelopers spend SO MUCH more time reading code than writing it.  This is true even with your own code.  As a favor to yourself and whoever will need to use, maintain or develop your code, please learn to write readable code. \nBut what about documentation, Evan?  Good question other Evan.  \nDocumentation does not remove the need for readable code.  Documentation is for users with no interest in reading source code; readable code is for developers who want to study, modify, fix, update, or in anyother way work with your codebase. (Including your futur self.  Love yourself.)  \nThere are many different opinions on what constitutes great JavaScript code.  The most important thing is just that you're consistent.  The war between coders that use tabs and coders that use spaces to indent their code is so engrained that it's essentially a joke by now, but it doesn't really matter as long as you're consistent.\n\nSelf-Documenting Code\nSelf-documenting code is code that reads almost like a very nerdy book.  \nYou have already begun your journey towards self-documenting code and you didn't even know it.  If you look to the process presented in tictactoes, the step from specs to empty code is giving you the start of a user-friendly project. The specs can become documentation for end-users, while the codebase is on it's way to being developmer-friendly:\n\nThe comments are pulled from the 'purpose' field of the spec - this gaurentees that you will have a 'why' comment for each component of the code. \nYou are building your code around pure functions.\nThe required functions, arguments, and return values are pre-declared with descriptive names.\nGlorious.\n\nRules of Thumb\nStructural:\n\nPlace all the 'workings' of your app in one place.  This means function calls, important variable assignments (or reassignment), and any other lines crucial to understanding your code.   With good naming, this can make your app read like a continuous story instead of a bunch of sentences split up through a phone book. (see example) \nUse single-purpose, pure functions with simple, understandable behavior.\nHave a helpful directory structure\nWithin a single file - organize variables, functions, objects, ... in a way that makes sense so you don't have to rescan the whole file all the time.\n\nNaming:\n\nAll names of things describe what they do, even if it means having realllly long names. \nWrite helpful error messages\nDecide on and stick to a naming convention. ie. camelCase or under_scores, var forty_two = 42, ...\n\nSyntax:\n\nUse prettier.js to make your coding style consistent. (white space, code blocks, functions, ... visually consistent)\n\n\nShow intermediate values. ie. none of this: (array[3])()[title].name.splice(3)\nPhrase things in the most clear way, not the most 'elegant' or short way.  No one will care how brilliant you are when they're 15 minutes in and just starting to understand your code. (personal experience here)\n\nDo Complete Refactors.  \n\nWhen your application or code changes, go through (at least most of) your codebase to reflect that change - modify variable and function names, reorganize what functions do what, even change your directory strucutre.  \n\nThe better you are about starting with readable code, the easier it will be to keep your code readable.\n\nTwo Examples\n1\nConsider the following 2 snippets of JavaScript:\n// difficult to read\nconst x = \nfunction(z) {\nlet w = 0;z.forEach(\nfunction(q){\n     w += q;\n});return w;\n};\n\nx([2, 2, 2]);\n\n// easy to read\nconst sumArray = function(array) {\n  let sum = 0;\n  array.forEach(function(number) {\n    sum += number;\n  });\n  return sum;\n};\n\nsumArray([2, 2, 2]);\n\nBelieve it or not, both of those functions do the exact same thing (in the exact same way!), and both of them are perfectly valid code, but obviously the second one is much easier to follow.  Imagine you're working on a project with someone else and they've written the first function... how long is it going to take you to figure out what's going on there so you can do your work?  Imagine you're working on a project all by yourself and YOU wrote the first function a week or two ago... chances are good that you aren't going to remember exactly what you were up to there and it's still going to take you a good while to figure it all out again.\nThe second one, however, is much easier to follow.  Even if you don't know exactly what everything in the code is doing, things are named clearly enough that you could guess, and the indentation is consistent enough that it's easy to parse the different parts of the function.\n2\n\n // -----------  Define things in one place ------------ //\n var command_line_args = process.argv.slice(2);\n var first_arg = command_line_args[0];\n var second_arg = command_line_args[1];\n function check_input_type(input, expected_type) {\n         // return true or false\n     };\n function add_two_numbers(num_1, num_2) {\n         // return the sum of num_1, num_2\n     };\n function display_to_user(result) {\n         // console log result\n     };\n\n // ------------- Use the stuff you defined elsewhere --------------- //\n var first_arg_is_valid = check_input_type( first_arg );\n var second_arg_is_valid = check_input_type( second_arg );\n if (first_arg_is_valid && second_arg_is_valid) {\n     var sum_of_args = add_two_numbers( first_arg, second_arg );\n     display_to_user( sum_of_args );\n } else {\n     display_to_user( \" invalid argument types \" );\n };\n\nThis is overkill for code that only adds two numbers, but it gets the point across. In more complicated or abstract programs the time spent writing clear code will more than pay off later.\n\n\n\nResources\nMandatory reads:\n\navoid comments\nwhen you can't, make sure they help\nand certainly learn to know when they are apropriate  \ncode for the maintainer.

GIT and Github allows you to protect your code against silly mistakes, organize, and document your code so others know how to use it and what to use it for.\n\nWhat's GIT ?\n\nGit is a command-line application that allows you to travel through time.  Every commit saves a complete image of your directory structure at the time of commiting (actually your staged directory structure, but whatever for now). \nGit allows you to create alternative universes.  With branches you can save two copies of the same directory that differ by a single file/method/bug/...  This is very practical for testing experimental features, fixing bugs, or sharing work across a group.\nGit allows you to commune with parallel dimensions.  'Pull' and 'push' allows your local git commit tree to synchronize with a git tree located anywhere on the internet.  This is how you will use GitHub and how multiple people are able to collaborate on the same codebase.\n\nGit has more tricks up it's sleeves, but these 3 will carry farther than you can see without awakening your third eye.\nWhat's GitHub ?\ntl;dr - it can be anything you need it to be.  \nWe'll be discussing the following uses in this course:\n\nRemote hosting for Git repositories.  With pushing and pulling, you can use GitHub to back up your work.  If you stop there, you're a fool. GitHub can do so much more for you.\nPersonal portfolio. GitHub has built-in tools for hosting static pages. With a little ingenuity this can be used to build a pretty sick portfolio that's fully integrated with your GitHub account.\n\nThese are for you to explore on your own:\n\nSocial network and linkedin for developers.\nProject hosting and project management.\nAn infinite library of useful code to study or use. \nInteractive documentation.\nIntegrator with many apps - we've used sketchboard.io's integration.\n\n\nWe've created this curriculum entirely on GitHub relying mostly on these features: github pages, organizations, issues, repo hosting, and projects.\n\nHow does this all fit together ?\n\nGit is like a really epic save button for your files and directories - officially Git is called a version control system.\nTo compare, a save in a text editor would record all of the words of a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file like essay.doc unless you make duplicate copies (which would be difficult to remember to do and keep track of):\nessay-draft1.doc, essay-draft2.doc, essay-final.doc\nA save in Git however, would record differences of files and folders AND keep a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub for sharing and collaborating with other developers.\nWhile Git works on your local machine, GitHub is a remote storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider the ability to use Git as an essential skill for a modern web developer to have; having a portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.\nIn the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why Git is so useful.\nAnd finally, you will set up a project with Git and this will serve as a template for setting up your future projects.\nLearning Outcome:\nBy the end of this lesson you should be able to:\n\nDefine what kind of program Git is\nDescribe the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping\nDescribe whether Git and GitHub work at a local or remote level\nDescribe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers    \n\n\nSSH keys\na how and why to article\n\nStudy resources:\n\nGit and Github in plain English.

It divides a given application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to, and accepted from, the user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.\n\nAs with other software architectures, MVC expresses the \"core of the solution\" to a problem while allowing it to be adapted for each system. Particular MVC architectures can vary significantly from the traditional description here.\nLink to lecture: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DRN0fLdsaxKGuPzvVDqx-7r-HuuzJIALNTOGcLsBp6w/edit#slide=id.g1f5e13c63b_0_7\nComponents\nThe model is the central component of the pattern. It expresses the application's behavior in terms of the problem domain, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. \nA view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. \nThe third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.\nInteractions\nIn addition to dividing the application into three kinds of components, the model–view–controller design defines the interactions between them.\nA model stores data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the view. \nA view generates new output to the user based on changes in the model. \nA controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., scrolling through a document, movement of document).\nExercises\nRewrite TicTacToe as an MVC app?\nDo here\n"},"application-design/data-modeling.html":{"url":"application-design/data-modeling.html","title":"Data Modeling","keywords":"","body":"Data Modeling 1\nNow that you're separating your apps into MVC you need to store your data separately from everything else.  Your data doesn't need to be stored anything like how it's displayed, it's the view object's responsibilty to make sure our data is readable.  This leaves you free to organize our data however you want; arrays, objects, variables, data-objects, you name it.\nAfter you become comfortable with the idea of a decoupled view and data store, you have much more liberty in designing your apps.  You also have a whole new set of decisions to make - how to organize, store, and retrieve your data.\n\nWho Uses Your Data For What?\n\nApps = Data + Interaction\n\nAfter you are clear on what data your application needs, the first 2 questions you should ask yourself are ...\n\nWhat interactions will my model need to support? \nWhat's the simplest possible way to implement those interactions?\n\nOnly after you can answer these questions should you begin writing your data model.\nThe backbone of your application is the model.  If the model is inefficient your app will be slow. Ff your data is stored in a convoluted way your view will be diffcult to write. If the model isn't logicial other people will have diffculty understanding what your app is for. \nData modeling is a gigantic topic, you could make a career out of it.

Fielding used REST to design HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). The term is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: it is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting links, such as /user/tom, and operations such as GET or DELETE (state transitions), resulting in the next resource (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user for their use.\nWeb service APIs that adhere to the REST architectural constraints are called RESTful APIs. HTTP-based RESTful APIs are defined with the following aspects:\n\nbase URL, such as http://api.example.com/resources/\nan internet media type that defines state transition data elements (e.g., Atom, microformats, application/vnd.collection+json, etc.) The current representation tells the client how to compose requests for transitions to all the next available application states.

Intuitively you can tell that a simple list of names is quite different from an interconnected social network, but how?  This lesson will give you some vocabulary to start exploring the differences.  \n\nRelationship Types\nData relationships and data types can be classified by their degree of interconnectedness.  From the example above: \n\nA simple list of names has no connections between names, each one is a free-standing data entry with no cares in the world.\nA social network has inidivuals:  \nAn individual can only have 1 bio and that bio is only connected to one individual.  \nOne individual can have multiple statuses, but each status can only have 1 individual.  \nEach individual can be connected to multiple other individuals. \n\n\n\nFrom a data modeling point of view there are only 3 numbers - 0, 1, and 'many'.  A data relation is between two units of data, the relationship types are the possible ways of combining 0, 1 and 'many':\n\nZero to Zero:\n\n\n\nOne to One:\n\n\n\nOne to Many,  or Many to One:\n\n\n\nMany to Many:\n\n\n\n\nThat's about all you need to know to get started.  \n\nExercises\nNo exercises, just the Data Model and *Book projects.\n"},"application-design/microservices.html":{"url":"application-design/microservices.html","title":"Microservices","keywords":"","body":"Microservices\n\n\"The secret to building large apps is never build large apps.

I'm a programmer, I'm not a hacker, I program ALL the time.\n\nHackers hack humans. They hack human psychology, like magicians.\n\nIf you wanted to get into someone's computer, you COULD learn about cryptography, write a program that runs through all the combinations in a few minutes… or you could just download one off the internet. No hacking required.\n\nThe hard part is getting access to someone's computer for those few minutes. But, what if they're an email correspondence with you?\n\nYou could email them an innocuous virus that causes glitches with their OS. You would have already established yourself as “good with computers,” so you offer to take a look.\n\nOh! But you have this thing this afternoon, so maybe you can just borrow the laptop, fix it, and meet back for dinner?\n\nThey'll basically tell you their password, from which you can probably guess all their other passwords. You download all their history so you know what banks they go to, and what social media they use. Remove the virus you implanted on their computer, and act smug during dinner. Allowing them to praise you for how good you are with computers.\n\nThat's hacking.\n\nWhen you spend hours, like Sherlock Holmes, finding out all the secret information about your crush on social media, that's hacking. It's the same techniques hackers use to get passwords, social security numbers, and addresses.\n\nPeople are predictable, and they always think they're not. That's why hacking seems so magical, and this generation has turned it into a magic show on tv.\nAnswer thanks to Mohammed Islam.\n\nWhat is Hacking?\nHacking is making a computer system do what you want it to, not what it was intended for.  \nAll the other answers to this Quora question focus on the more technical side of hacking a computer system, but don't mention the heart of it.  The heart of hacking is that every system is unique, and every possible system design must have some vulnerability.  Since humans have designed and use almost all systems, humans are usually the weak point.  Do you use the same passwords everywhere? Do you have passwords written down in a notebook on your desk?  These are greater vulnerabilities than any other.\n\nCyber-Security 102 - the non-human\nThe fancy numbery stuff\n95% of this:  some things take VVVEERRYYY long to compute or guess\nPrime numbers, prime factors:  public/private keys\nEmail verification codes\nHashing, salting, …\nCommon types of security risks:\n\nDenial Of Service: Overload the system with requests until it breaks.\nPhishing: You were gulible enough to follow a questionable link.\nMalwares, trojans: Small programs that run on your computer. Probably because you were gulible enough to install them.\nBack doors: Intentional flaws in the source code.\nUnintentional flaws in design: sql injection,  buffer overflow, ... these take quite of bit of technical know-how to detect and attack, but also make up a small portion of all attacks\n\nMost of these are humans making mistakes or even intentionally sabotaging your system.\nTake away: \n\nThe algorithmic/computer side of netowrk security is really quite solid.  \nThe human side is pretty weak.\n\n\nSecurity in Node.js/NPM\nOne great vulnerability in the Node.js world is open source modules.  A well-built module will be secure - large random numbers are nearly impossible to guess whether or not the source code is exposed.  \nBut what if there's one method in mongoose that has a faulty if-statment?  All of a sudden anyone using mongoose in their project is open to attack by a stubborn hacker who read the entire code base.\nWhat happens when your project contains 30 dependancies, and each dependancy has 15 dependancies?  Any of those dependancies can be updated by their owners at any time.  Or any one of those hundreds of dependacnies could have a tiny security risk you don't even know to look for.\nHere is an article about being safe with NPM:\n\narticle\n\nHere are some more articles about being safe with NPM:\n\nRisingstack article\n\"NPM isn't safe\". - a google developer\nnodesource article\nthe leftpad affair\nI peeked into my node_modules folder ...\nExpress on using Express\n\n"},"core-libraries/":{"url":"core-libraries/","title":"Core Libraries","keywords":"","body":"resources for learning the libraries from our projects\n"},"core-libraries/ejs.html":{"url":"core-libraries/ejs.html","title":"EJS","keywords":"","body":"EJS\nEJS stands for Embedded Javascript and is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. \nRead this documentation about using templates with Express: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html\nUsage\nIn your express-app you'll will need to import the module and set EJS as your view engine:\napp.set('view engine', 'ejs');\n\nThe set up of the view engine is necessary so that the render method knows which templating format to expect:\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res){\n    res.render(\"home\")\n})\n\nIn the above we render the home.ejs file every time somebody visits our root page. We can leave out the format as we have explicitly set the view engine as EJS. By default Express will look for your files in the views directory. If your ejs files are stored in another directory, you will have to explicitly point Express to it.\nOnce this is setup you can directly embed data in your views.\n\n  \n\n\nYou can see that this is some hybrid form of plain JS and HTML markup. What is important here is the use of the tags. Everything between those tags will be evaluated and will return your data. The tags you need to know are below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%> Plain ending tag\n-%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline\n\nPartials\nTo avoid having to repeat yourself in every single file, you can create partials. Partials are chunks of code you write once and then include in other files. The most common use cases are the beginnings and ends of every HTML file, the headers and footers.\nLet's say we have the following ejs file:\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nFor every ejs file we write the beginning will always be the same: we'll define the doctype, open the html tag, head tag, body tag,... Instead of writing this for every single file. We write this once and include it in the other files.\nOur header.ejs file then becomes:\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\nWhich we then include into our users.ejs file (footer.ejs would then only include the closing body and html tags):\n\n    \n            \n    \n\n\nExternal resources:\n\nDocs: http://ejs.co/\nNPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs\nsimple tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application\n\n"},"core-libraries/lodash.html":{"url":"core-libraries/lodash.html","title":"Lodash","keywords":"","body":"Lodash\nA module for functional programming and immutable data in JS.  \nList of resources  \n\nthe docs are very good  \negghead  \nvooban  \ncolintoh  \n\nExercises  \n\nnodeschool lololodash  \nTDD style     \nalso TDD style  \nironhack labs.
