# Algorithms 101
This is an enormous topic and has been treated many many times over by others online. For that reason this lesson is just a list of resources.  Because algorithms are such a broad and tricky subject, every resources starts somewhere different and explains it even more differently.  Take a look through some of the resources and choose the ones that you like best.  

Please let us know which are most helpful! We're always looking to improve this reference book!

### Study Tips
 
When studying a difficult algorithm try these tricks:  
	* Pick a specific, simple input and walk through the algorithm by hand.  
	* Make diagrams of what happens to the argument as the algorithm transforms it.  
	* Ask yourself what types of arguments are easy or difficult for this process to work with.

For more information on wrapping your head around algorithms you can refer to the [Exercises page from Programming Resources](https://elewa-academy.github.io/General-Resources/programming-resources/exercises.html).
