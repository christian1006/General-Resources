# JavaScript Exercises

Working on JavaScript exercises serves two main functions - learning how JavaScript works, and learning how to _use_ JavaScript.  We like to think a little more about the second.  On this page you'll find links to some quality JS exercises and a list of resources that will help you learn some good techniques for solving problems with code.
