# NPM
NPM is a few things:
* An organization supporting and organizing the JS dev community.
* An online archive of javascript modules - code anyone can use.
* A commandline app that allows you to access the archive and manage the modules once you've installed them on your computer.

If this doesn't quite make sense yet, that's fine. After a week it'll pull together.  
In the meantime you can check out their [website](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm), they explain themselves very well.
